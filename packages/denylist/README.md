## Getting started

## Environment setup

- Add secrets

    wrangler secret put SENTRY_DSN --env $(whoami) # Get from Sentry
    wrangler secret put LOKI_URL --env $(whoami) # Get from Loki
    wrangler secret put LOKI_TOKEN --env $(whoami) # Get from Loki
  ```

- `pnpm run publish` - Publish the worker under desired env. An alias for `wrangler publish --env $(whoami)`
